# Nodejs-RESTful-API
Simple RESTful API hosted with NodeJS that gives from local machine JSON info if you write http://127.0.0.1:8081/giveusers
I have a need to create mobile app that works with RESTful API, thou there are no API's of thin kind of info on the net. 
This is "raw" app logic that will be alter used to deploy info to angularJS mobile app.
